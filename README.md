# customize-3D-portal

Web portal to customize T-shirt by applying logo and full texture image by choosing image file from system. 
AI generated (openai) library for generating log/full texture from text to image, currently is not working, becuase the api I used is paid. if someone can clone this project, and inside of server/.env file, if anyone can modify api key with paid key, then the option to create image from text would work perfectly fine also.
