#Customize 3D Portal
- Welcome to our web portal that allows you to customize T-shirts by applying logos and full texture images.
- You can easily choose an image file from your system to create a unique design for your T-shirt.
- Our portal also features an AI-generated library (powered by OpenAI) that can generate logos and full textures from text to image.
- Please note that currently, the AI library is not working due to the API being paid. However, if you clone this project and modify the API key in the server/.env file with a paid key, the option to create an image from text will work perfectly fine.
- We hope you enjoy using our portal to create one-of-a-kind T-shirt designs!
